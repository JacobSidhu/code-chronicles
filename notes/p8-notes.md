# Learning Outcomes: First Missing Positive Integer

## Key Concepts

### Index Mapping
- **Index Mapping Technique**: The core of our solution is based on placing each number in the position corresponding to its value, which is known as index mapping. This is especially useful for identifying missing numbers in a sequence.
- **Efficiency**: By mapping numbers directly to their indices, we can easily determine which numbers are misplaced or missing, allowing for an efficient scan of the array.

### In-Place Array Modification
- **In-Place Operations**: Our solution modifies the array in place, swapping elements to their correct positions without requiring additional space for another data structure.
- **Space Complexity**: Achieving O(1) extra space is crucial for scenarios where memory usage is a constraint.

## Algorithm Efficiency

### Time Complexity
- **Single Pass Corrections**: The while loop inside the for loop, which places elements in their correct positions, runs in O(n) time despite the nested appearance. Each element is moved at most once.
- **Final Scan**: A subsequent linear scan, also O(n), is used to find the first missing positive, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n).

### Practical Use Cases
- **Constrained Environments**: This approach is ideal for environments with limited memory availability, such as embedded systems or low-resource computing devices.

## Lessons Learned

### Problem Solving
- **Edge Cases Handling**: It's crucial to consider various scenarios, such as arrays with negative numbers, duplicates, and large gaps between positive integers.
- **Validation**: Testing with diverse arrays ensures that the solution handles all edge cases effectively.
