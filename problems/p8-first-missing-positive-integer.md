# Problem: First Missing Positive Integer

## Problem Statement
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the smallest positive integer that is missing from the array.

### Example Input/Output

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `[1, 2, 0]`  
**Output**: `3`

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `[3, 4, -1, 1]`  
**Output**: `2`

#### Example 3:
**Input**: `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`  
**Output**: `1`

---

## Constraints
1. The array can have both positive and negative integers.
2. Your solution should run in \( O(n) \) time and use constant \( O(1) \) extra space.

---

## Hints
1. Think of the problem as sorting integers within a specific range.

2. Use the array itself to track the presence of integers instead of allocating extra space.
