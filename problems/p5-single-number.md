# **P5 - Single Number**

## **Problem Statement**
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

---

## **Constraints**
- \(1 \leq \text{length of array} \leq 3 \times 10^4\)
- Each integer in the array appears exactly twice, except for one integer which appears only once.

---

## **Input Format**
- A list of integers.

---

## **Output Format**
- An integer representing the single number.

---

## **Example**

nums = [2, 2, 1]

**Output**
1
