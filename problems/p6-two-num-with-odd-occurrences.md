# **P6 - Two Numbers with Odd Occurrences**

## **Problem Statement**

Given an array of integers where all elements appear an even number of times except for two numbers that appear an odd number of times, find the two numbers that occur an odd number of times.

### **Constraints**
- \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^6 \)
- Array size will always be even.
- The array contains only integers.
- Only two numbers occur an odd number of times; all other numbers appear an even number of times.

### **Input Format**
- An integer array, `arr`, of size \( n \).

### **Output Format**
- A pair of integers representing the two numbers that appear an odd number of times.
